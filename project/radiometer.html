      <p>A radiometer is a device that spins when placed in sunlight. Although initially created as a scientific instrument, today they are more like toys. Since sunlight passes through windows as well, I decided to incorporate a radiometer into the windowpane itself. This way, something plain and everyday like a window has a playful element added to it.</p>
