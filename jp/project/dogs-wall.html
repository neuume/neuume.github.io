      <p>* Winning entry - Architecture for Dogs design competition at <a href="https://www.japanhouselondon.uk/" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japan House London</a>. *<br> Selected by Tim Marlow, Head of the <a href="https://designmuseum.org/" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Design Museum</a>.</p>
      <p>“Dog’s Wall” is a false wall that offers a cosy hideaway for a dog as well as practical shelving for its human companion. Within the wall are several openings through which the dog can perch itself to observe the room and interact with its owner, as well as more secluded spots to allow a dog a comfortable personal space.</p>
      <p>Holes in the wall where the dog can stick its head out offer opportunities for playful interactions, while integrated storage and shelving space creates a practical function. By combining the human’s and dog’s space within a home and creating a “shared” environment, the world of human and dog are integrated in a more equal dynamic than Pet and Owner.</p>
      <p>Tim Marlow’s comments:<br>

  “ I like the good use of space and the idea of the dog as spectacle and spectator… framed high up on the wall like a living sculpture!”</p>
