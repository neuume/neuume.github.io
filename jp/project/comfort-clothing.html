    <p>“Comfort-Seeking Clothing” is a set of several wearable objects and garments that either express or evoke a sense of comfort, sleepiness, and insulated vulnerability. I adapted the pure-white language and sensations of duvets, pillows, and pyjamas evoking a safe and sleepy feeling, as well as mimicking the functional and vulnerable feeling of medical or convalescent clothing.</p>
    <p>Confined to our homes, we’ve spent the last year in a cocoon-like state of hibernation and self-care, the scope of our daily environments becoming exclusively domestic and interior, our instincts for empathy imprinted into inanimate things.</p>
    <p>As protection from a real but intangible threat in the outside world becomes the most important priority, the importance of the sense of comfort in insulation against the outside is more tangible than ever, our home spaces infused with hospital-like feelings of convalescence from the increased sense of vulnerability and dependance on the sterile and medical in daily life.</p>
    <p>Most important to me in this project was to instil a sense of “anchoring” or “grounding”, so I designed and made a set of weights to attach to different points on the body that can also be removed and sit on pressure points. A large Tetrapod-shaped pillow is a huggable human-scale version of sturdy concrete coastal wave defences, creating a feeling of protection and security.</p>
