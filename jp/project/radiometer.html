      <p>A radiometer is a device that spins when placed in sunlight. Although initially created as a scientific instrument, today they are more like toys. I’ve been fascinated by them for a while, it’s very calming to idly watch mine spin in the morning sun before I leave the house. Since the sunlight passes through a window to reach the radiometer, I decided to incorporate the radiometer into the windowpane itself. This way, something playful can be embedded into something as plain and everyday as a window.</p>
