            <p>Short Story: Lunar Day</p>
            <p>Thursday</p>

          <br>
          <p> I originally wrote this short story in 2018 as Sample Text for a Typeface designed by a friend of Mine, each paragraph typeset in increasingly heavy weights. I still quite like it, so I'm putting it here.</p>
          <p style="text-align:center;">...</p>
          <p>This morning I woke up an inch above my bed. Disoriented and still shaking off the dust of sleep, I fumblingly turned on my bedside lamp, which itself was an inch midair above the table, the table’s feet suspended an inch above the floor. Around my room, every object was levitating yet perfectly still, as if suspended buoyant underwater.</p>
          <p>Tentatively, I attempted to shift my weight over the side of the bed, the duvet floating up towards the ceiling as I unwrapped myself. The bed was heavy enough that I could grab onto it to get myself upright and carefully lower myself onto the floor. Scraping the carpet with my toes, I was able to clumsily propel myself to the window, opening the blind. The morning sky was filled by an expansive creamish terrain, pockmarked and riddled with divots and horns. Its surface seemed close enough to scrape the radio antennae on the roofs of neighbouring homes, filling the air with a pale otherworldly glow.</p>
          <p>Breakfast was difficult. The water for my coffee refused to pour downwards, instead streaming upwards and dissipating into a scalding hot stratum of fog at about eye level, forcing me to hunch over to stop my glasses from clamming up. I cracked some eggs onto the frying pan, where they began to hover in slowly-spinning discs as they fried. The cheese in my fridge all seemed to be sticking magnetically to its ceiling, vibrating with a dull hum.</p>
          <P>From the kitchen window I watched as pedestrians grappled unsuccessfully at lampposts to stop themselves from being pulled into the Lagrange point between the Earth and the Moon. Frogs flung through the air above the roofs, their jumps having propelled them at unexpected speeds and trajectories, each glassy-eyed face a picture of surprise as they rocketed into the atmosphere. Upside-down flying herons snapped each one up with zeal.</p>
          <p>As the Moon loomed closer and closer, the atmosphere was saturated in an electric-tasting light so lush it seemed like a liquid. The entire contents of the nearby aquarium had floated free of the tanks, forming a silver cloud layer of jellyfish spooling their shiny tendrils, writhing black octopuses, and spider crabs snapping at algae, all punctuated by rod-like vertical eels and shoals of mercury-tinted garfish murmurating as they too were snapped up by the herons.</p>
          <p>In a single moment, the golden light was suddenly subsumed by black as the Moon seemed to flip over itself to reveal its dark side, receding slowly into the inky sky. No longer projected by the magnetic pull of its gravity, the objects around the room softly descended onto their respective places.</p>
          <p>The gradual ombre from the Moon’s gravity to the Earth’s slowly saturated me enough to make me aware of the weight of my limbs, the afterimage of the warm glow of lunar light still ringing in my head. Everything was now dipped in a deep soporific lacquer, filling ankle-deep around my feet and furniture as I waded back to my bedroom. The windows open, the liquescent essence of night had flooded back into the room, a bathypelagic dark casting a perfect anaesthetic negative of its volume. My body heavy as lead, I could barely stay awake as I lay on the mattress, the gentle hum of the house’s electricity lulling me once more into sleep.</p>

            <p>Sensing Magnetism</p>
            <p>Wednesday</p>
            <p>2021 06 09 - 6:00 PM</p>

          <br>
          <p>(Adapted from a Diary Entry)</p>

          <p>It's often a favourite moment of mine whenever a person takes out a compass in the midst of some paranormal event in some Horror or Sci-fi Movie I'm watching and sees it spinning and pointing erratically. Magnetism is a powerful physical force that constantly surrounds and permeates us, but it's not something we can directly sense. We know it's there, but it's invisable -- Imagine if you could only feel if it was hot or cool by use of a thermometer, or if you could only sense the presence of sound through a decibel meter. So, even though it's something so intangible, there's a really specific eerieness to seeing it being somehow meddled with, like the actual fabric of reality around you is being ruffled or passed through invisibly.</p>
          <p>Of course, we're able to feel a physical sense of magnetism by holding a magnet itself, either feeling the strength of its pull towards and attachment to ferrous metals, or its slippery repellance from another magnet. I wonder what it would be like if we could directly feel the sensation of this pushing and pulling from magnets at all times -- it would probably feel like a "toughness" or "looseness" or maybe "hardness" or "softness" of the air around it, requiring extra strength to push through or otherwise throwing you off balance by suddenly slipping through it -- Kind of like walking against a strong gale that pushes you backward when you jump, or makes you stumble forward when it suddenly relents. It's also nice to imagine playing with just a small magnet, feeling your fingers pushed and pulled by it as you pass your hand through its field.</p>
          <p>Although Humans may not be able to sense it, Scientists have identified Magnetoreception in several organisms. Magnetotactic Bacteria align themselves according to the earth's magnetic field, a behaviour called Magnetotaxis, using nanometre-sized magnetite or iron sulfide enclosed within their cells, chains of which essentially acting as interior magnetic needles. Lines of these bacteria magnetically stick together, their bodies forming a microscopic compass in tandem.</p>
          <p>Magnetoreception and Magnetotaxis has also been observed in many types of animal - invertebrates, fish, mollusks, amphibians and mammals. Researchers observed that by changing the direction of a magnetic field around a tank of Sockeye Salmon, they could influence the direction of their swimming, and when Red Foxes pefrorm their high-jumping attacks to catch small rodents, they tend to do so in a north-eastern compass direction, suggesting some ability of magnetic orientation. Even Cattle and Roe Deer have been observed to align their bodies magnetically when resting and grazing -- Researchers used Satellite imagery to analyse their headings when resting, and found a strong preference for the north-south direction. They also observed that herds resting near electromagnetically-turbulent areas such as those around High Voltage Power Lines aligned themselves in random directions, further supporting their usage of magnetoreception.</p>
          <p>Despite the large number of animals observed to be able to sense magnetism, Researchers have yet to definitively identify a specific sensory receptor for magnetism -- the closest lead being the identification of Magnetite in the beaks of Homing Pidgeons, Theoretically explaining their ability of nighttime navigation. I wonder what it would be like to have this innate sense of direction, I imagine it would be as unthinking as any other proprioceptive sensation. Some languages, such as Guugu Yimithirr and Sambali, use north/ west/ east/ south in place of left/ right/ forward/ backward, but it seems as if this is largely influenced by the presence of geographical markers such as Mountains / the path of the sun plus acute proprioceptive ability instead of a direct "sense" of the earth's magnetic field.</p>
          <p>Like we use thermometers or decibel meters to Tabulate an invisible sensation into a measurable form, I wonder if it's possible to do the reverse. The "FeelSpace Navibelt", invented by Udo Wächter, aims to augment Magnetorception though physical means by use of weak motors in a ring around the body, the one pointing northmost faintly vibrating. In the six weeks of testing it, Wächter found he had developed an innate sense of direction that transcended only a sensation of buzzing; his brain had transformed the faint touch into a large part of its direction-keeping system so deeply that he could even feel it in his dreams-- After removing the belt following weeks of wearing it, Wächter said he felt so completely disoriented that he soon bought a personal GPS try to regain the sense of direction he had felt while testing the belt. Today, the belt is used to help direct the Blind while navigating. <br><br>I wonder if you could do the same kind of thing for more local fields, like a small ring that buzzed according to how strong the magnetic field in your immediate vicinity is. Perhaps If you filled an entire room or house with hundreds of compasses, you could get it dense enough that you could hallucinate a sensation of the currents and flowing of magnetism by observing the subtleties of its effect on the compasses around you, like feeling a breeze in a field by watching the stalks wave around you.</p>
